%               MM - August 06 2008 - removed call to internal matlab
%                    'pack'.  In current versions of matlab, pack can
%                    only be called from the command line.
% CALL SYNTAX:  qBalanced;
%
% PRE: The following scripts have been been called:
%               MJO_MASTER.m
%               BALANCED_CALL.m
%               balancedBasis.m
%
% POST: A matlab format output file is written to 
%       the directory "matFiles" found in the parent directory
%       "models". The file name is field_b_q.mat and contains
%       the variable b_q = b_q(yHat,xi). Also has the vertical
%       structure applied to it.
%

% Start statement
disp('  qBalanced.m script         : [b_q(yHat,xi)] - b potential vorticity')

% Hermite expand q
qH = bHermite(qmn,H0,Hn,yHatVec,mMax,nMax);

% Inverse fourier transform the Hermite expanded, balanced q
bqF = bIFourier(qH,yHatVec,xiVec,mMax);

% Find vertical structure Z(z)
Z = structureZ(p);

% Get total balanced q field b_q(yHat,xi,z)
b_q = Z*bqF;

% save b_q field
disp('  Saving b_q(yHat,xi)        : [b_q] -> matFiles/field_b_q.mat')
save ./matFiles/field_b_q.mat b_q
clear qH Z
