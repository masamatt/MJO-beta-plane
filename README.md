## I. Overview
This repository contains the original model code used in the _Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans_ journal article (Schubert and Masarik, 2006)<sup>[2](#2)</sup>, as well as the MS thesis (Masarik,  2007)<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.  The description here will follow the later.

## III. Model Operation
The first step is to download a copy of this repository to your computer using `git` by
issuing the following command in a terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model              # clone locally as, ./mjo_eq-wave_model
```
Next change directories to the cloned repository root directory, and start MatLab from there
```bash
cd mjo_eq-wave_model
matlab
```
From the command prompt inside the MatLab program you can start a model simulation by calling the main run script
```matlab
MJO_SIM
```

## IV. Thesis Abstract
> POTENTIAL VORTICITY AND ENERGY ASPECTS OF THE MJO THROUGH
>                   EQUATORIAL WAVE THEORY
> 
>   Considering linearized motion about a resting basic state, we derive analytical solutions
> of the equatorial beta-plane primitive equations under the assumption that the flow is steady
> in a reference frame moving eastward with a diabatic forcing resembling a Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)
> convective envelope.  The spectral series solutions allow us to
> decompose the total response into equatorial wave components.
>
>    The diabatic source term in the potential vorticity (PV) principle contains a factor 
> of `beta * y` which acts to suppress PV generation at the equator, while  maximizing it at the
> poleward edges of the convection.  In this way a moving heat source can produce two ribbons
> of lower tropospheric PV anomaly, a positive one off the equator in the northern hemisphere
> and a negative one off the equator in the southern hemisphere, with oppositely signed PV
> anomalies in the upper troposphere.  An approximate relationship between the geopotential
> and streamfunction is used to formulate an invertibility principle.  The balanced wind and 
> mass fields recovered from inverting the primitive equation PV quite accurately reproduce
> the flow west of the forcing.  While this result demonstrates the MJO wake response can
> be described by simple PV dynamics, it also illustrates the Kelvin response ahead of the 
> convection cannot be captured within this balanced framework.
>
>    We then derive the primitive equation total energy principle which reduces to a balance
> between generation and dissipation under the assumed steady state.  The total energy 
> can be expressed as a physical space integral, or equivalently as an infinite sum in spectral
> space through a Parseval relation.  Using the spectral sum we can isolate the individual
> equatorial wave contributions to the total energy.  The dependence of wave response energy
> on the horizontal shape, propagation speed, and meridional position of the prescribed
> forcing are examined by evaluating the Parseval relation for different values of these
> forcing parameters.

## V. Primitive Model
The governing equations for the primitive equation model are presented in [Sec 2.1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.1.pdf).  These 
equations in 3-dimensional space are separated into horizonal and vertical structure equations in [Sec 2.2](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.2.pdf). In 
[Sec 2.3](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.3.pdf) the prescription of the diabatic forcing term for the horizontal structure problem is given.  Assuming steady-state conditions in a reference frame translating [App C](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_xi_coord.pdf) at a constant speed with the prescribed diabatic forcing, the horizontal structure equations are solved in [Sec 2.4]().
