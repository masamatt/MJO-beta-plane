## I. Overview
This repository contains the original model code used in the _Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans_ journal article (Schubert and Masarik, 2006)<sup>[2](#2)</sup>, as well as the MS thesis (Masarik,  2007)<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.  The description here will follow the later.  A schematic outlining the computational procedure for the model is given in [App F](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_comp_proc.pdf). Introductory information on the MJO can be found in [Ch 1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_ch1_intro.pdf).

## III. User Guide


#### III.i. - Download Repository
Download a copy of the repository to your computer using `git` by
issuing the following command at a prompt (`$`) in a terminal
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model
```
<br>

#### III.ii - Run Model:  MJO_RUN.m
Change directories to the cloned repository root directory, and start MatLab from there
```bash
  $ cd mjo_eq-wave_model
  $ matlab
```
From the command prompt (`>>`) inside MatLab you can start a model simulation with default parameters by calling the main run script
```matlab
  >> MJO_RUN
```
You will then be prompted to run either the primitive equation model (`0`) or the balanced model (`1`).  If you enter `1` for the balanced model no more input is needed and the model will start solving for the balanced theory solution.  If you entered `0` for the primitive equation model, you will then be prompted for which equatorial wave component should be run
```matlab
Choose from the wave components for the Primitive Model.
                                                        
      Wave Components   Wave ID                         
      ---------------   -------                         
           All waves  =   0                             
         Rossby wave  =   1                             
          Mixed wave  =   2                             
        Gravity wave  =   3                             
         Kelvin wave  =   4                             
                                                        
Enter the wave ID number [0,1,2,3,4]:
```
Entering a wave ID `1` to `4` computes the response for that particular equatorial wave componment, while entering `0` computes the total wave solution, i.e., the sum of waves `1-4`.  

The model will run for ~O(5 min), computer dependent, and will automatically open a plot of the output upon completion.

#### III.iii - Set Run Parameters:  MJO_PARAMS.m
The file [`MJO_PARAMS.m`](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/MJO_PARAMS.m) is a script containing all the parameters available to the user for configuring the model forcing and resolution.  Edit the following parameters then run the script `MJO_RUN.m` to compute the solution for the selected parameters.

## IV. Thesis Abstract
> POTENTIAL VORTICITY AND ENERGY ASPECTS OF THE MJO THROUGH
>                   EQUATORIAL WAVE THEORY
> 
>   Considering linearized motion about a resting basic state, we derive analytical solutions
> of the equatorial beta-plane primitive equations under the assumption that the flow is steady
> in a reference frame moving eastward with a diabatic forcing resembling a Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)
> convective envelope.  The spectral series solutions allow us to
> decompose the total response into equatorial wave components.
>
>    The diabatic source term in the potential vorticity (PV) principle contains a factor 
> of `beta * y` which acts to suppress PV generation at the equator, while  maximizing it at the
> poleward edges of the convection.  In this way a moving heat source can produce two ribbons
> of lower tropospheric PV anomaly, a positive one off the equator in the northern hemisphere
> and a negative one off the equator in the southern hemisphere, with oppositely signed PV
> anomalies in the upper troposphere.  An approximate relationship between the geopotential
> and streamfunction is used to formulate an invertibility principle.  The balanced wind and 
> mass fields recovered from inverting the primitive equation PV quite accurately reproduce
> the flow west of the forcing.  While this result demonstrates the MJO wake response can
> be described by simple PV dynamics, it also illustrates the Kelvin response ahead of the 
> convection cannot be captured within this balanced framework.
>
>    We then derive the primitive equation total energy principle which reduces to a balance
> between generation and dissipation under the assumed steady state.  The total energy 
> can be expressed as a physical space integral, or equivalently as an infinite sum in spectral
> space through a Parseval relation.  Using the spectral sum we can isolate the individual
> equatorial wave contributions to the total energy.  The dependence of wave response energy
> on the horizontal shape, propagation speed, and meridional position of the prescribed
> forcing are examined by evaluating the Parseval relation for different values of these
> forcing parameters.

## V. Model Description
blah
<br>

#### V.i Primitive Equation Model
The governing equations for the primitive equation model are presented in [Sec 2.1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.1.pdf).  These 
equations in 3-dimensional space are separated into horizonal and vertical structure equations in [Sec 2.2](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.2.pdf). In 
[Sec 2.3](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.3.pdf) the prescription of the diabatic forcing term for the horizontal structure problem is given.  Assuming steady-state conditions in a reference frame translating [App C](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_xi_coord.pdf) at a constant speed with the prescribed diabatic forcing, the horizontal structure equations are solved in [Sec 2.4](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.4.pdf).  Plots of the horizontal solutions fields are displayed for a given pressure surface in [Sec 2.5](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.5.pdf).
