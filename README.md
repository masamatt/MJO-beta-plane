## IV. Thesis Abstract
The following is a reproduction of the thesis Abstract.<br>
> POTENTIAL VORTICITY AND ENERGY ASPECTS OF THE MJO THROUGH
>                   EQUATORIAL WAVE THEORY
> 
>   Considering linearized motion about a resting basic state, we derive analytical solutions
> of the equatorial beta-plane primitive equations under the assumption that the flow is steady
> in a reference frame moving eastward with a diabatic forcing resembling a Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)
> convective envelope.  The spectral series solutions allow us to
> decompose the total response into equatorial wave components.
>
>    The diabatic source term in the potential vorticity (PV) principle contains a factor 
> of `beta * y` which acts to suppress PV generation at the equator, while  maximizing it at the
> poleward edges of the convection.  In this way a moving heat source can produce two ribbons
> of lower tropospheric PV anomaly, a positive one off the equator in the northern hemisphere
> and a negative one off the equator in the southern hemisphere, with oppositely signed PV
> anomalies in the upper troposphere.  An approximate relationship between the geopotential
> and streamfunction is used to formulate an invertibility principle.  The balanced wind and 
> mass fields recovered from inverting the primitive equation PV quite accurately reproduce
> the flow west of the forcing.  While this result demonstrates the MJO wake response can
> be described by simple PV dynamics, it also illustrates the Kelvin response ahead of the 
> convection cannot be captured within this balanced framework.
>
>    We then derive the primitive equation total energy principle which reduces to a balance
> between generation and dissipation under the assumed steady state.  The total energy 
> can be expressed as a physical space integral, or equivalently as an infinite sum in spectral
> space through a Parseval relation.  Using the spectral sum we can isolate the individual
> equatorial wave contributions to the total energy.  The dependence of wave response energy
> on the horizontal shape, propagation speed, and meridional position of the prescribed
> forcing are examined by evaluating the Parseval relation for different values of these
> forcing parameters.
