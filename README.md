## I. Overview
This repository contains the original model code used in the _Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans_ journal article (Schubert and Masarik, 2006)<sup>[\[1\]](#1)</sup>, as well as the MS thesis (Masarik,  2007)<sup>[\[2\]](#2)</sup>.  The description here will follow the later.  Introductory information on the tropical weather phenomenon that is the subject of the study, the Madden Julian oscillation (MJO), can be found in [Ch 1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_ch1_intro.pdf).  

Two models are available within the repository.  The first, derived from the [primitive equations](#Vi-Primitive-Equation-Model) on an equatorial beta-plane, is contained mostly in the directory `primitive/`.  The second model is contained mostly in the directory `balanced/`, and is derived from the primitive equation [potential vorticity](#Vii-Balanced-Model) (PV) principle together with a linear balance relation.  The directory `lib/` contains a few routines shared between both models.  A directory containing scripts to plot the output, `plotting/`, has been added.<br>
 
Only 3 scripts, all located in the root directory, are needed to operate the model.  The first [MJO_RUN.m](#iiiii---run-model--mjo_runm) calls a simulation.  The second [MJO_PARAMS.m](#iiiiii---set-run-parameters--mjo_paramsm) contains the user adjustable parameters controlling physical aspects of a simulation.  The last [MJO_PLOT.m](#iiiiv---plot-model-output--mjo_plotm) contains parameters for plot appareance and makes the plotting call as well.<br>

## III. User Guide

#### III.i. - Download Repository
Download a copy of the repository to your computer using `git` by
issuing the following command at a prompt (`$`) in a terminal
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model
```
The model is composed of Matlab scripts and functions and is ready for use once downloaded.
<br><br><br>



#### III.ii - Run Model:  MJO_RUN.m
Change directories to the root directory in the cloned repository, and start Matlab from there
```bash
  $ cd mjo_eq-wave_model
  $ matlab
```
From the Matlab command prompt (`>>`) start a model simulation (using default parameters) by calling the main run script ([`MJO_RUN.m`](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/MJO_RUN.m))
```matlab
  >> MJO_RUN
```
You'll be prompted to run the primitive equation model (`0`), or the balanced model (`1`).  
```matlab
Which model should be run?
        Primitive: 0
        Balanced:  1
Enter [0 or 1]:
```
If you enter `1` for the balanced model no more input is needed and the model will start solving for the balanced theory solution.  If you entered `0` for the primitive equation model, you'll then be prompted for which equatorial wave component(s) should be run
```matlab
Choose from the wave components for the Primitive Model.
                                                        
      Wave Components   Wave ID                         
      ---------------   -------                         
           All waves  =   0                             
         Rossby wave  =   1                             
          Mixed wave  =   2                             
        Gravity wave  =   3                             
         Kelvin wave  =   4                             
                                                        
Enter the wave ID number [0,1,2,3,4]:
```
Entering a wave ID `1` to `4` computes the response for that particular equatorial wave componment, while entering `0` computes the total wave solution, i.e., the sum of waves `1-4`.  

The model will run for ~O(5 min), computer dependent.  While running, status output will continuously be displayed to the Matlab console.  Once the run is finished a figure window will automatically open with a plot of the output.
<br><br><br>



#### III.iii - Set Run Parameters:  MJO_PARAMS.m
The file [`MJO_PARAMS.m`](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/MJO_PARAMS.m) is a script containing all the parameters available to the user for configuring the model forcing and resolution.  Edit the following parameters then run the script `MJO_RUN.m` again to compute the solution for the newly selected parameters.
<br>

| Parameter | MatLab Variable | &nbsp;&nbsp; Units &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description | Sample Value |
|:---------:| --------:|:--------------:|:------------| ------------:|
| Q<sub>0</sub>/c<sub>p</sub> | `Q0_cp`  | \[K day<sup>-1</sup>\] | diabatic heating rate | `12` |
| a<sub>0</sub> | `a0_km` |    \[km\]   | zonal half-width of diabatic heating  | `1250` |
| b<sub>0</sub> | `b0_km` |     \[km\]   | meridional e-folding width of diabatic heating  | `450` |
| y<sub>0</sub> | `y0_km` |    \[km\]    | meridional displacement of diabatic heating from equator  | `450` |
| c  | `c` |   \[m s<sup>-1</sup>\]    | zonal translation speed of diabatic heating | `5` |
|    |     |                  |        |           |
| N  | `nMax` |    \[ \]     |  maximum meriodional mode (int) |  `200` |
| M  | `mMax` |      \[ \]       |  maximum zonal wavenumber (int)  |  `200` |
|   | `zonalDomain` |      \[ \]       |  extent of physical space zonal channel to display (float) | `0.5` |

<br><br>



#### III.iv - Plot Model Output:  MJO_PLOT.m
The script [`MJO_PLOT.m`](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/MJO_PLOT.m) is automatically called at the end of the script `MJO_RUN.m`.  Inside `MJO_PLOT.m` are parameter options that can be set to make some adjustments to a plot.  You can simply edit the parameters then call the script from the Matlab prompt
```matlab
>> MJO_PLOT
```
without having to do another run, and a new figure window with an updated plot will open.  As an aside, since a new figure will be opened each time `MJO_PLOT.m` is called, any number of figures can be generated and left open during new simulations so different run plots can be compared side-by-side.<br>

The output plots are formatted to each have three panels displaying the output fields in the equatorial channel, and are listed here from the top
1. potential vorticity (`q`)
2. wind + geopotential height (`u`,`v`,`phi`)
3. vertical pressure velocity (`omegaM`)

For the default parameters listed in the table above this section, the output plot for each possible simulation are listed below:

Notice in the [Kelvin wave plot](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/PKa1250b450y450_2019-11-29_135702.pdf), the 1st panel (potential vorticity) is blank and it's peak values are both zero -- this is correct, and is a characteristic of the Kelvin wave that it's PV field is always identically zero.  For this and other cases where fields are zero Matlab will generate warning output similar to the following
```matlab
Warning: Contour not rendered for constant ZData 
> In contourf (line 60)
  In plot_PV (line 62)
  In plotFields (line 70)
  In MJO_PLOT (line 46)
  In MJO_RUN (line 118) 
>>
```
which can safely be ignored and is just stating Matlab can't contour a constant (0) field.  Another circumstance when this will occur is for any model configuration where the meridional displacement (of the center of the diabatic heating envelope) from the Equator is zero (y<sub>0</sub>=0).  In this case the mixed Rossby-gravity wave is not excited due to it's anti-symmetry with the equator, and all it's fields are identically zero.<br>

## V. Model Description
The two models ([primitive equation](#vi-primitive-equation-model), [balanced](#vii-balanced-model)) described below comprise the original model code.  The plots for <sup>[\[1\]](#1), </sup><sup>[\[2\]](#2)</sup> were produced at the time by Brian McNoldy using IDL software.  The core model code remains unchanged, though  plotting scripts have now been added to automatically plot the output within Matlab.  This scripts have been made to emulate as close as possible the look of the original IDL plots, though are formatted in three panels which display all five of the dependent variable fields solved for.

The parameters for input, or 'forcing', for the model are contained within `MJO_PARAMS.m` and allow the user to specify the characteristics of the diabatic heating.  This diabatic source term is intended capture the net effect from an ensemble of cloud complexes (i.e., an upward transport of mass), and in that way resembles a MJO-like convective envelope.  The primitive equation model then solves for the wind (`u`,`v`), geopotential (`phi`), vertical pressure velocity (`omegaM`), and potential vorticity (`q`) response to the translating diabatic forcing in the equatorial channel.  The balanced model recovers the 'rotational wind' field (`u_psi`, `v_psi`) after first solving for the horizontal stream function (`psi`), and solves for `phi`, `omegaM`, and `q` as before.  
<br><br>


#### V.i Primitive Equation Model
The governing equations for the primitive equation (PE) model are presented in [Sec 2.1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.1.pdf).  These 
equations in `(x,y,z,t)`-space are separated into horizonal `(x,y,t)` and vertical `(z)` structure equations in [Sec 2.2](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.2.pdf) by way of a [vertical normal mode transform](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_vert_norm_mode.pdf).  Justified by the comparison of [observed vertical heating profile (Q/c<sub>p</sub> vs. Z')](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/diabatic_vert_prof.pdf) with the (derivative of the) first vertical internal mode, we make the simplifying assumption that the heating excites only the first internal mode.  In this way the infinite series of vertical modes is truncated to a single mode.  In 
[Sec 2.3](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.3.pdf) the prescription of the diabatic forcing term for the horizontal structure problem is given.  Assuming steady-state conditions in a reference frame translating at a constant speed ([App C](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_xi_coord.pdf)) with the center of the prescribed diabatic forcing, the horizontal structure equations are solved in [Sec 2.4](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.4.pdf). 

> The solution can be considered as the primitive equation generalization of the simplest MJO model involving the first 
> baroclinic mode response to a moving planetary scale heat source under the long-wave approximation (Chao, 1987).<sup>[\[3\]](#3)</sup>

Due to the spectral series solution of these shallow water equations, the full wave response can be decomposed into equatorially trapped  wave components.  The [frequency disperson curves](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/prim_eq_disp.pdf) for each component can be displayed as by Matsuno, 1966<sup>[\[4\]](#4)</sup>. Plots of the horizontal solution fields for the total response as well as each component are displayed for a given pressure surface in [Sec 2.5](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_2.5.pdf).  Finally, a schematic outlining the computational procedure for solving the primitive equation model is given in [App F](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_comp_proc.pdf).
<br><br>


#### V.ii Balanced Model
The balanced model is borne out of the primitive equation PV principle derived in [Sec 3.1](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_3.1.pdf).  An invertibility principle is then defined in [Sec 3.3](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_sec_3.3.pdf) by introducing an [equatorial linear balance relation](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/mtm_thesis_eq_bal.pdf) along with boundary conditions to the principle.  The [balanced model and low-frequency PE dispersion curves](https://github.com/masamatt/mjo_eq-wave_model/blob/master/docs/prim_bal_disp.pdf) are overlayed for comparison.<br>
