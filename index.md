# MJO Equatorial Wave Model

The **Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)** is a tropical weather phenomena which originate in the Indian Ocean and propagates eastward along the
Equator until dying out near the dateline in the colder waters of the eastern Pacific.  The MJO is made up a large-scale convective envelope
moving eastward near the equator accompanied by the equatorial wave response to the translating heat source.  The total wave response is a sum
of the individual wave components: _Eastward and Westward Inertio-gravity_ waves, _Kelvin_ wave, _Mixed-Rossby gravity_ wave, and _Rossby_ wave.  The
Rossby wave response is found to the West of the convective cluster and the Kelvin wave response to East of the cluster.  The research done
with the model contained in this repository looks at the MJO as a composition of these equatorial wave components and then investigates the
degree to which it's dynamics can be captured from it's **potential vorticity (PV) principle**.
